# Big-Data Architectures
This repository contains some of the architectures developed in [__Big-Data Architectures__](https://github.com/darkreapyre/BDA-dev.git) to take  what I've learned with `Python` and `R` and applying it at scale to ecosystems like __Hadoop__, __Spark__, __DC/OS__ and __FLink__. 
The `Notebooks` created by using these architectures holds various `RStudio`, `Jupyter` and `Zeppelin` examples and can be found in the [__Big Data Analytics__](https://github.com/darkreapyre/Big-Data-Analytics.git) repository. 

## Architectures  
__Spark.local__ - Spark 1.5.2 stand alone cluster (no Hadoop) for use on a laptop.  
__Spark.vsphere__ - Hadoop 2.6 with Spark 1.5.2 (deployed with Ansible) on a VMware vSphere cluster.
__DC/OS__ - Work in progress
__FLink__ - Work in progress
